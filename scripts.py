    Arguments: 
        intersections: as outputted by get_county_district_intersections,
            a dictionary whose keys are ordered pairs (county, district)
            and whose values are the geometries corresponding to the 
            intersections.

    Output: dictionary whose keys are ordered pairs (county, district)
        and whose values are the populations within these intersections.
    
    Note: There is some imprecision associated with this function.  If a 
        district boundary splits a block group, then there is no way to assign
        the members of the block group to their district(s) with certainty. 
        (Luckily, all block groups are in exactly one county.)  When a 
        block group is split, we assign population by area, which is the best
        proxy we have for population.
        
        Furthermore, since the district shapefiles from the census are drawn 
        separately from the block group files (i.e. there are no block group
        equivalency files), it may be the case that the districts do not
        entirely cover a block group.  In this case, we assign the population
        of the block group proportionally to intersections that were found,
        so as to preserve the total population of the state.
